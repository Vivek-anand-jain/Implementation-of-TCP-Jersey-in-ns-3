# Implementation of TCP-Jersey in ns-3
## Course Code: CS821
## Assignment: #FP7

### Overview

TCp-Jersey [1] is a variant of TCP, It makes TCP to perform better in wireless and wired-wireless hybrid networks environment by differentiating the packet losses caused by network congestions from the losses caused by wireless link errors. This
repository provides an implementation of TCP-Jersey in ns-3 [2].
